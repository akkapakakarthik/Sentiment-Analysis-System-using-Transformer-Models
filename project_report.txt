Sentiment Analysis with Fine-tuned GPT-2 Model
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in a piece of text. The project uses the Sentiment140 dataset, a popular dataset for sentiment analysis.

Project Components:
Model: GPT-2 for Sequence Classification

The project uses the GPT-2 architecture for sequence classification. GPT-2, developed by OpenAI, is a powerful language model capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
Task: Sentiment Analysis

The primary task of this project is sentiment analysis. The model is trained to classify text as either positive or negative sentiment.
Dataset: Sentiment140 Dataset

The Sentiment140 dataset is utilized for training the sentiment analysis model. This dataset consists of 1.6 million tweets labeled with sentiment (0 for negative, 4 for positive).
Project Workflow:
Data Preprocessing:

The Sentiment140 dataset is loaded and processed to extract the relevant columns (target and text).
Text data is tokenized using the GPT-2 tokenizer, and labels are converted to numerical format.
Model Training:

The GPT-2 model for sequence classification is fine-tuned using the preprocessed dataset.
The model is trained for a specified number of epochs with an AdamW optimizer and a cross-entropy loss function.

Interact with the Gradio Interface:
After the model is trained, a Gradio interface is launched, allowing users to input text and receive sentiment predictions.

Additional Notes:
Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs based on your requirements.
Evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation set for a more comprehensive assessment.
